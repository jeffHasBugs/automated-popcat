This is a Python script that automates sending clicks to the popcat server. 

It randomly sends between 750 to 800 clicks to https://stats.popcat.click/pop on a 30-second interval,
sending clicks directly using HTTP requests instead of interacting with the browser.

Popcat allows a maximum of 800 pops to be sent every 30 seconds, per IP address.

These are the headers sent along the HTTP POST request to avoid triggering Cloudflare's bot detection.
